# Spatiotemporal Deep Learning Models for Human Action Recognition in Interdisciplinary Physics Applications

## Overview
Human action recognition is a crucial task in video understanding with wide-ranging applications across **surveillance**, **healthcare**, and **sports analytics**. Despite significant advancements in deep learning, current methods often struggle to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns and contextual dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in diverse real-world scenarios. This project proposes a novel framework that integrates deep learning with **spatiotemporal modeling** to enhance action recognition accuracy and robustness.

Our framework features a **hybrid architecture** combining convolutional and attention-based mechanisms to extract hierarchical spatial and temporal features from video sequences. By leveraging **domain-aware optimization strategies**, our approach incorporates auxiliary tasks such as **motion segmentation** and **context reasoning** to improve interpretability and robustness. The model also employs a **multi-scale temporal aggregation mechanism**, which enables the capture of both short-term motion dynamics and long-term action dependencies.

Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, with significant improvements in handling noisy, imbalanced, and complex video data. This work establishes a foundation for **robust**, **scalable**, and **interpretable** action recognition in interdisciplinary **physics applications**.
